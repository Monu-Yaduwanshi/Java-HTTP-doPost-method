# Java Servlet Application with doPost Method 🌐

Welcome to the **Java HTTP doPost Method** project! This simple yet powerful application demonstrates how to handle POST requests in **Java Servlets**, generating dynamic HTML content based on user input. The project showcases a user-friendly registration form and dynamically displays the submitted data on a new page.

## 🚀 Features

- **📋 User Registration Form**: 
  - Collects key details such as **Name**, **Age**, **Branch**, **Semester**, **Gender**, and **Hobbies**.
  - Designed with structured HTML inputs like text fields, dropdowns, and checkboxes for an enhanced user experience.
  
- **📝 Dynamic HTML Response**: 
  - After form submission, the **Servlet** processes the POST request and generates a dynamic page displaying the user's registration details.

- **🔄 Seamless Navigation**: 
  - Includes links for easy navigation to other parts of the application, enhancing user interaction.
